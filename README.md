# Film-Director-Gender-Analysis
Analyzing the careers and trends of female film directors with respect to male directors.

All work in the FemaleDirectorAnalysis.ipynb file.

### Some questions that can be answered:
    
    - how long until female directors get a chance to direct a 2nd movie?
    - do female directors hire a more diverse cast and crew?
    - do flops effect the careers more than they do male directors? (may be hard to answer due to small sample size)
    - do female directors direct certain genres more than others?
    - can we distinguish between movies directed by males/females?
